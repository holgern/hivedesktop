# The BeerTicketLottery

The math of #BeerSaturday is a mixture of **engagement** and **a random number**.

https://steemitimages.com/DQmP9eyWTgdF8oKSHfeqgxJtRqFahvekVfftfAKWEvUzjS9/BeerSaturday%20Math.png

From all that numbers **everybody gets an specific amount of HIVE #BeerSaturday lottery tickets** and we do the math and choose the winner by a random number - That ticket will win.

## Means, a higher upvote to **_this main post_** - get's a higher chance to win the challenge.

This HIVE challenge offers a fair chance - even to a tiny minnow - to win a prize. We calculate the winner by the engagement, amount of upvotes and by a random number process.


## Notes
- You may post on any weekday but add our hashtag #BeerSaturday
- You might post more than one of your articles, bu only the one with most votes goes to the lottery
- I will check the results on Saturday midnight (California Time Zone) after I wake up on my sunday
