Hi there! The introduce yourself tag is use to help new users of the blockchain let people know who they are, is supposed to be use on your intro post and if you do an update post of who you are to the chain.

The Minnow Support Project is primarily a resource for new or small Hive accounts, but [PALnet]( http://minnowpond.org/) is for EVERYONE! We provide a place to meet people, listen to a 24/7 streaming broadcast staffed by blockchain users, chatting and networking, getting help with proofreading or formatting, and to participate in a community curation initiative to help more people grow while exploring and discovering blogging, dapps, and games on the Hive blockchain!

MSP to help promote undervalue post on the blockchain and reward the good job done by minnows has a team of curators that do manual curation every day of the week on different categories, and I (@victoriabsb) will be doing manual curations every week of 5 post using the tag #introduceyourself tag. This post will showcase some of the amazing new users we have on chain!.

From that moment on I started to like metals, jewels, alloys. How useful and necessary they are in today's modern society. </sub>
